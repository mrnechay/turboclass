# turboclass
A class being currently developed to streamline the usage of Turbomole particularly for enzyme systems.  Short-term goals include ability to perform single point and geometry optimization calculations with automatic troubleshooting, as well as streamlined constrained optimizations with troubleshooting, for more efficient transition state optimizations.
